CORTANA: an extendable and remotely-accessible personal manager AI written in Python.


DEPENDENCIES:
python (included in my linux distros, sudo apt-get install python)
espeak (sudo apt-get install espeak)
nltk (sudo pip install nltk)


INSTALL:
1. run 'python cortana config'
2. done.


USAGE:
'python cortana "what time is it?"'


UNDER DA HOOD:
Cortana uses NLTK to match input with a "module," or piece of code written for a specific purpose. It then runs the identified module. This makes extending Cortana's capabilities extremely easy.


ADDING YOUR OWN MODULES:
1. Write your python module and save it in the /modules directory.
2. run 'python cortana addcommand [modulename] "[example call command]"

Important: only use the filename for the [modulename] field, not an entire path. Also: Cortana disects the [example call command] like it would disect the actual call. With this in mind, it may be helpful to you to add synonyms for some of the words in your [example call command]. Take a look:
python cortana addcommand createfile "make,create file test.txt"
This way, you can call the createfile command using either make or create as your verb.


FUTURE:
- support for recognition of  pronouns or variable-like "targets" in command.
- write a server so Cortana can be accessed remotely.
- make it easier for Cortana to interact with other applications.
- add voice-to-text functionality.
- get list of installed modules
- LOTS more.
